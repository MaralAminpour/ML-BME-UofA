In this facinating journey, we'll be exploring machine learning as seen through a variety of case studies across diverse BME applications. This approach will help to solidify the fundamental principles at work. Rather than diving straight into the complicated details of algorithms and methods, we'll take a more practical approach that closely mirrors real-world scenarios.\n","\n","Here's the thing: if we dig into algorithms right off the bat, we often end up with overly simplistic use cases that don't really reflect what you'll encounter in reality. Therefore, we're going to shake things up in this course. Our first step will be to consider real-life use cases. This hands-on strategy will give you\n","\n","- a deeper understanding of the core concepts and\n","- techniques required to build intelligent applications,\n","- gauge their performance or quality, and determine whether they're functioning optimally.\n","\n","By the end of this course, you'll have a handful of these intelligent applications under your belt! To create such applications, we'll need to consider several questions: What task am I aiming to accomplish? Is it a classification problem? What machine learning models should I use, such as support vector machines or regression? How can I optimize the parameters of my chosen model? Lastly, is the system delivering the level of intelligence I'm aiming for and how can I quantify its quality?\n","\n","In this course, we'll delve into the nitty-gritty of model description and optimization in subsequent courses. Our initial focus, however, will be on determining the task at hand, identifying appropriate machine learning techniques, and understanding how to measure their effectiveness. We'll primarily use algorithms as 'black boxes', allowing us to construct a variety of genuinely intelligent and exciting applications together.\n","\n","Don't worry, we'll actually get our hands dirty by coding and building these applications in diverse ways. As we progress through this course, which includes 11 weeks and a capstone project, we'll dive deeper into different areas. Here's a sneak peek of the depth and variety we'll be exploring throughout this exciting course.\n","\n","**NOTE: you need to change this according to our course**\n","\n","So the regression course is going to talk about various models of predicting a real value, so for example, a house price from the features of the house. And we're going to discuss linear regression techniques, we're going to discuss advanced techniques like ridge regression and lasso that allow you to select what features are most appropriate for your problem. We're going to talk about optimization techniques like gradient descent and coordinate descent to optimize the parameters of those models. As well as some key machine learning concepts like loss functions, bias-variance tradeoffs, cross-validation. Things that you need to know to really take this method and kind of improve them, develop them and build applications with them."],"metadata":{"id":"-es3Kt4J7Vs7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning**\n","\n","Artificial Intelligence is the broader umbrella under which Machine Learning and Deep Learning come.

We know exactly what ingredients go in, and we can predict what will come out, just like we use equations to predict results in our models.\n","\n","On the other hand, machine learning is more like a magical cooking pot. We understand the basic idea - that the pot learns from what we've cooked before to make new dishes. But the exciting part is, we don't always know exactly what the pot will whip up next, or why it chose to add a pinch of this or a sprinkle of that (this is often called a 'black box model').\n","\n","Traditional science uses 'white box' models, where we know exactly how the inputs become outputs, like using a set formula. On the other hand, machine learning is more of a 'black box' model. We know the machine is learning, but we don't always understand the hows and whys of what it learns. This mystery is sometimes seen as a drawback of machine learning.\n","\n","Some folks might not like the mystery pot method, arguing that not fully understanding the process could be a problem.
