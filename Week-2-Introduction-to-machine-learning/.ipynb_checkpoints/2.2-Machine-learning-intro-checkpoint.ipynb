    "\n",
    "The goal of machine learning is to create a model that makes a prediction about something that we can observe. The model is a mathematical function that takes input (some information we can measure or collect about samples) and returns a prediction. Usually we will train our model by providing it with example where we already known the correct answer (_supervised learning_). But we want our model to return good predictions even for new or unseen data. Sometimes we will use machine learning just to identify patterns in the data (_unsupervised learning_)."
