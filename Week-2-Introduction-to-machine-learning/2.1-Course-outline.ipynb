Students must submit a project proposal to the instructor by the deadline in the course schedule. The project will require reading of relevant literature and the creation of Python code. The project will require three components to be submitted: (1) a presentation during the last week of classes; (2) a written report detailing the problem, the methods used, and a discussion of the results; and (3) an archive containing all Python source code and data files. Detailed requirements and marking rubrics for the final project will be provided on the course GitHub and eClass.\n",
