    "This notebook is structured as a series of steps. Earlier steps must be completed before later steps for the code to run. Some partial code is provided; your solution should use that partial code. The solution doesn't need to be pretty! Make sure the code runs without errors. All required imports will be provided for you; you shouldn't import any other modules. You may need to check with the documentation for the NumPy, Matplotlib or Pandas packages, or other online sources. There are multiple solutions for most tasks."
