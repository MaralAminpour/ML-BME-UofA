    "Some partial code is provided; your solution should use that partial code. The solution doesn't need to be pretty! Make sure the code runs without errors. All required imports will be provided for you; you shouldn't import any other modules. You may need to check with the documentation for Python or NumPy, or other online sources. There are multiple solutions for most tasks."
