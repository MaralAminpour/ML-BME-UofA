The model is a mathematical function that takes input (which is some information that we can measure or observe about samples) and returns a prediction. Usually we train our model by providing it with samples where we already know the correct answer (*training data*); this type of machine learning is called _supervised learning_. But ideally we want our model to return good predictions even for new or unseen data. Sometimes we will use machine learning just to identify patterns in data; this type of machine learning is called _unsupervised learning_.

    "- *Prognostic* In this case we want to predict the likely progress or survival of a patient.\n",
    "- *Treatment* Here we want to predict the best treatment option.\n",
