    "### What is classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **classification** machine learning problem, we are interesting in predicting which **class** a sample will be in based on one or more features of the sample. Classes sometimes also termed labels. The goal of our model is to predict which class a sample is in. This is a type of supervised learning where we will train our models using labeled data. Examples of classes include \"healthy\" vs \"disease\"; or \"healthy\" vs \"minor disease\" vs \"serious disease\". If we have exactly two classes, then we have a **binary** classification problem. For a binary classification problem, it is common to designate one class as positive (or label 1) and another class as negative (or label 0). If we have more than two classes, then we have a **multiclass** (or **multilabel**) problem. "

    "Machine learning is a bit like a kid who only likes to play with numbers and not with words. So, when we have categories like **'apple' and 'peer'**, we need to find a way to turn them into numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where one-hot encoding comes in handy! It's a cool trick that turns these categories into something machine learning algorithms can work with. It's like giving each category its own 'on' and 'off' switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "And guess what? There's an easy way to do this if you're using pandas, a tool in Python. It has a function called 'get_dummies' that does all the work for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I thought it would be intresting for you to know**: the term \"one-hot\" in \"one-hot encoding\" comes from the way digital circuits are designed. In digital electronics, a one-hot signal is a group of bits among which the legal combinations of values are only those with a single high bit (1) and all the others low (0)."

    "Let's explore machine learning with a fun example from Kaggle, a competition site owned by Google. These contests can be for giggles, cash prizes, or even a job offer sometimes! The Titanic Kaggle Challenge is known as one of the classic examples for learning classification in a hands-on way.\n",
    "\n",
    "One beginner's challenge is based on the Titanic disaster, a famous shipwreck that happened on April 15, 1912. The ship, thought to be unsinkable, hit an iceberg and sank, sadly causing 1502 out of 2224 people onboard to lose their lives because there weren't enough lifeboats.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's not just about guessing who made it. It's about deeply exploring the data, finding patterns, and understanding how different factors might have affected survival rates. It poses questions like 'Did socioeconomic status influence survival rates?' and 'What was the impact of the \"women and children first\" policy? Was the 'women and children first' policy strictly followed?'\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the interesting part: it seems that some people were more likely to survive than others. The challenge asks us to figure out who these folks were, using data like their names, ages, genders, and social classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get a file with details about 891 passengers, including whether they survived or not. We'll use this data to teach our machine to make smart guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the real test comes with another file, this one has information on 418 passengers, but doesn't tell us if they survived. That's where our machine's predictions come in!\n",
