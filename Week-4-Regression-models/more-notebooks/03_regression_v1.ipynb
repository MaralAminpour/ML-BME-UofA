In this context, the \"intelligence\" we're seeking to derive is the potential value of a house that's not currently on the market. Our goal is to estimate this unknown value using data.\n","\n","So, where does this data originate? For this case, we'll be studying other houses, using their sale prices as a basis to infer the potential value of our target house. But the sale price isn't the only factor we're considering. We'll also look at various characteristics of these houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the total square footage, among other things.\n","\n","Our machine learning strategy will be to establish a relationship between these house features and their sale prices. By successfully modeling this relationship with our data from past house sales, we can then use it to predict the sale price of a new house. In simpler terms, we'll be taking the new house's attributes to forecast its potential sale price. This practical technique is known as regression."],"metadata":{"id":"LV9F0F_lRN4W"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Data: Prices of houses and other features**\n"," <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1uIHJsWM4l5mWtsuaFnn-CcTCkv0wD3O_' width=600px align=\"center\">\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pC4Qy-IsrV4H"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**sale price of a new house**\n","\n"," <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1usPRRGU4wGPa65lXFhVSwb9rkgxWIiCx' width=150px align=\"center\">"],"metadata":{"id":"MGBawoWis4Lz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Suggested videos and tutorials about predicting house prices**\n","\n","1.
