To illustrate this, here's a handy cheat sheet that draws parallels between the two. Trust me, you'll find the transition smoother than you think!

Python isn't fond of semicolons at the end of each line. Python does not require semicolons at the end of each line to prevent the interpreter from printing out the values of each variable\n","\n","2. Python is all about clean, simple structure, so it uses only indentation to control the flow of the code.
