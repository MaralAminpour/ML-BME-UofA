    "Welcome to the fantastic world of NumPy! The name NumPy is short for \"Numeric Python\" or \"Numerical Python\", and it's a key building block for scientific programming in Python. It's open-source (which means it's free and everyone can contribute to it) and it's been designed with efficiency in mind.\n",

And the cherry on top? NumPy comes equipped with a host of functions to play around with these arrays, including some advanced linear algebra routines which are optimized for dealing with really, really big matrices.\n",

    "### 4.5.1 Flattening matrices/tensors into one long vector\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions (```ravel``` and ```flatten```) seem to do the same thing on the surface, but there's a key difference between them. When `flatten` reshapes an array, it creates a brand new copy in your computer's memory. On the other hand, `ravel` is like a thrifty tailor - it reshapes the array but doesn't use any extra memory because it keeps referring back to the original array. While this makes `ravel`faster and more memory-efficient than `flatten`, it could also lead to some unexpected results or may result in undersired behaviour, as you'll see in the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to unraveling an array using the `ravel` and `flatten` functions in numpy, you have the option to specify the order in which the elements are flattened. The \"order\" parameter allows you to choose between three options: \"C\" (default), \"F\", and \"A\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"C\" represents the row-major ordering, which is the same as how it would be done in languages like C/C++. It flattens the array in a way where the row index varies slowest, and the column index varies quickest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"F\" stands for Fortran column-major ordering. It flattens the array in a column-major fashion, where the column index varies slowest and the row index varies quickest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"A\" is a special option that preserves the original ordering style of the array. This can be either C or Fortran style, depending on how the array was originally created. The ordering style is saved as an attribute when the array is first created.\n",
    "\n",
    "By specifying the order parameter, you have the flexibility to choose how you want the array to be flattened.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The term \"unraveling\" in the context of arrays refers to the process of transforming a multidimensional array into a one-dimensional array. It essentially means flattening the array, collapsing all the dimensions into a single sequence of elements. This can be useful when you want to work with the array in a linear fashion or when you need to apply certain operations that expect a one-dimensional input. Unraveling allows you to access each element of the array individually, regardless of its original shape or dimensions."

    "While both `ravel` and `flatten` functions in numpy offer the same flattening behavior, there is an important distinction in how they handle the **memory** and the **relationship with the original array**.\n",
    "\n",

    "Here's how it works: Let's say we have two arrays, one with a shape of (3, 4) and the other with a shape of (1, 4). These arrays have different dimensions, but broadcasting comes to the rescue!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, broadcasting adds extra dimensions to the smaller array to match the dimensionality of the larger array. In this case, the smaller array will be transformed from a length-4 vector to a 1x4 matrix, making it compatible with the larger array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next, the smaller array is copied along the new dimension as many times as needed to match the size of the larger array.** In our example, the smaller array will be repeated 3 times along the row dimension until it has the same shape as the larger array.\n",

    "\n",
    "What this specifically means is if you have two arrays with different numbers of dimensions (e.g. a vector and a matrix), extra dimensions will be added to the smaller array to give it the same dimensionality e.g. and $1 \\times n $ matrix rather than a length $n$ vector - shape (,$n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific example, broadcasting allows us to sum a (3, 4) shaped matrix with a (1, 4) shaped array. The smaller array is broadcasted along the row dimension, copying it three times to match the shape of the matrix. This allows us to perform the summation effortlessly.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**`np.dot`**: When applied to two arrays A and B, `np.dot` estimates the sum product between the last axis of A and the penultimate axis of B. It performs the dot product along these specific axes, resulting in a new array.\n",

    "In addition to `np.matmul`, numpy offers other useful matrix product operations that you may find beneficial. Some of these include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`np.vdot`**: Calculates the dot product between two vectors and flattens the input arrays before performing the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`np.outer`**: Computes the outer product of two vectors, resulting in a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`np.tensordot`**: Allows for tensor contractions along specified axes, resulting in a new array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`np.einsum`**: Provides a powerful mechanism for performing a variety of tensor operations, including matrix multiplication, contraction, and summation, using a compact string notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These additional matrix product operations offer versatility and flexibility in performing various tensor operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with **`np.matmul`** as your trusted companion and these additional functions at your disposal, you're well-equipped to conquer the world of matrix operations in numpy!\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:**\n",

    "Regardless, the TL;DR (\"Too Long; Didn't Read\") of all this is that you are probably safest using ```np.matmul()``` for your matrix and vector multiplication operations.\n",
