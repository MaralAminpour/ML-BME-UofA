Students must submit a project proposal to the instructor by the deadline in the course schedule. The project will require reading of relevant literature and the creation of Python code. The project will require three components to be submitted: (1) a presentation during the last week of classes; (2) a written report detailing the problem, the methods used, and a discussion of the results; and (3) an archive containing all Python source code and data files. Detailed requirements and marking rubrics for the final project will be provided on the course GitHub and eClass.\n",

    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks will be essential for the course. The concepts and examples will both be delivered via notebooks. Assignments must be submitted in the form of a Jupyter notebook.\n",

    "### Using Notebooks on Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended option is to use Google Colab to run the notebooks. Links will be provided for each notebook every week. Here are the instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click on the Colab link for the notebook. Colab links for every notebook will be provided on eClass.\n",
    "2. When you try to run a cell in the notebook, you will get a message \"This notebook was not authored by Google\". Click \"Run anyway\".\n",
    "3. The notebook will be loaded read-only. To create an editable copy, either click on the \"Cannot save changes\" button or select the File>Save a copy in drive menu item. This will create a duplicate of the notebook in your Google drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the notebooks locally\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to using Google Colab you can download the repository from Github and install the dependencies locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, Python and Jupyter must be installed. If they are not installed, we recommend installing Python and Jupyter using Anaconda. Please follow the instructions [here](https://ualberta-rcg.github.io/python-intro/setup/) to install Python and Jupyter. Alternately, you can install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, download the repository by either:\n",
    "    - Use this link to download the repository as a zip archive: https://github.com/MaralAminpour/ML-BME-Course-UofA-Fall-2023/archive/refs/heads/main.zip\n",
    "    - If git is installed, you can clone the repository with this command:\n",
    "    `git clone https://github.com/MaralAminpour/ML-BME-Course-UofA-Fall-2023.git`\n",
    "    - Download and install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application. Then open the MaralAminpour/ML-BME-UofA-Fall-2023 repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install the dependencies by either:\n",
    "    - If pip is installed, you can install the dependencies with this command: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn graphviz seaborn torch`\n",
    "    - If Anaconda is installed, you can install the dependendies with this command: `conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn graphviz seaborn torch`\n",

    "\n",
    "### Mac OS X Users\n",

    "2) Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>spacebar</kbd> to launch Spotlight. Type `Terminal` and then double-click the search result or hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>\n",
