There are several inbuilt functions in numpy for this purpose like ```flatten``` or ```ravel``` for squashing our arrays into a single dimension, and we can reshape them to fit our needs using functions like ```reshape``` or ```resize```. Now, let's dive deeper into what each of these functions can do for us!\n","\n","### 4.5.1 Flattening matrices/tensors into one long vector\n","\n","The functions (```ravel``` and ```flatten```) seem to do the same thing on the surface, but there's a key difference between them. When `flatten` reshapes an array, it creates a brand new copy in your computer's memory. On the other hand, `ravel` is like a thrifty tailor - it reshapes the array but doesn't use any extra memory because it keeps referring back to the original array. While this makes `ravel`faster and more memory-efficient than `flatten`, it could also lead to some unexpected results or may result in undersired behaviour, as you'll see in the example below.\n","\n","When it comes to unraveling an array using the `ravel` and `flatten` functions in numpy, you have the option to specify the order in which the elements are flattened. The \"order\" parameter allows you to choose between three options: \"C\" (default), \"F\", and \"A\".\n","\n","- \"C\" represents the row-major ordering, which is the same as how it would be done in languages like C/C++. It flattens the array in a way where the row index varies slowest, and the column index varies quickest.\n","\n","- \"F\" stands for Fortran column-major ordering. It flattens the array in a column-major fashion, where the column index varies slowest and the row index varies quickest.\n","\n","- \"A\" is a special option that preserves the original ordering style of the array. This can be either C or Fortran style, depending on how the array was originally created. The ordering style is saved as an attribute when the array is first created.\n","\n","By specifying the order parameter, you have the flexibility to choose how you want the array to be flattened.\n","\n","**Note:** The term \"unraveling\" in the context of arrays refers to the process of transforming a multidimensional array into a one-dimensional array. It essentially means flattening the array, collapsing all the dimensions into a single sequence of elements. This can be useful when you want to work with the array in a linear fashion or when you need to apply certain operations that expect a one-dimensional input. Unraveling allows you to access each element of the array individually, regardless of its original shape or dimensions."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Z5MHtQvy4_Bc","outputId":"9b4feef1-0a3d-4417-8eda-33e26a203f19"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[[ 1  2  3]\n"," [ 4  5  6]\n"," [ 7  8  9]\n"," [10 11 12]]\n","the result of flattening A [ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12]\n","flattening A with row major ordering [ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12]\n","flattening A with column major ordering [ 1  4  7 10  2  5  8 11  3  6  9 12]\n","flattening A preserving the C/Fortran style of the original array [ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12]\n"]}],"source":["A=np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],[10,11,12]])\n","print(A)\n","Flattened_X = A.flatten()\n","print('the result of flattening A', Flattened_X)\n","print('flattening A with row major ordering',A.flatten(order=\"C\"))\n","print('flattening A with column major ordering',A.flatten(order=\"F\"))\n","print('flattening A preserving the C/Fortran style of the original array',A.flatten(order=\"A\"))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AX1XylZM4_Bc"},"source":["This behaviour is true for both ```ravel``` and ```flatten.``` The important difference is that if we subsequently edit the values of ```Flattened_X``` (the output of the ```flatten()``` operation) the original array ```A``` remains unchanged. On the other hand, this is not the case with ```ravel```, which continues to point to the location of ```A``` in memory. Thus it's important to carefully consider which behaviour is desired.\n","\n","While both `ravel` and `flatten` functions in numpy offer the same flattening behavior, there is an important distinction in how they handle the **memory** and the **relationship with the original array**.\n","\n","When you use flatten, it creates a new array `Flattened_X `that is a complete copy of the original array `A`.
