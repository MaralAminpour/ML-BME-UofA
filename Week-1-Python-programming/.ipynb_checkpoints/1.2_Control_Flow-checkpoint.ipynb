    "# 2. General Features of Control Flow Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how Python uses control flow &ndash; **the sequence in which the code is executed** &ndash; which can be guided by a few different types of statements. In our exciting notebook adventure, we're focusing on `if`, `for`, and `while` statements. But you should know that Python has other tools in its box like `try` statements for handling exceptions or cleanup tasks, and `with` statements (which allow execution of initialization and finalization code, prior to running a block of code).\n",
    "\n",
    "All these control flow statements have a thing in common, a general format. In pseudocode, it would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "main body of code\n",
    "\n",
    "control flow (if/for/while/try/with) statement :\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    \n",
    "return to main body of code\n",
    "```\n",
    "Don't forget to spot the colon at the end of the control flow statement. Following it, there are indented lines, which are like the runway lights guiding which block of code to execute (or skip) in response to the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Indentation is everything\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike matlab, which uses an 'end' to signal the end of a loop or statement, in Python control flow is indicated solely through indentation relative to the rest of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different types of identations are allowed: tabs or _n_ spaces. 4 spaces is the most conventional choice. Just be consistent!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/indentation.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 750px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to decode every bit of the syntax at this point. Just note how, with each '`for`' or '`if`' statement, the code shifts further to the right, almost like a gentle wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To do** Try writing up the `for` loop as shown in the figure above.  see what happens when you change the indentation of the lines\n"

    "<img src=\"imgs/debugging.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 750px;\"/>\n",

The ^ symbol points to the exact spot of the error within that line.\n",
