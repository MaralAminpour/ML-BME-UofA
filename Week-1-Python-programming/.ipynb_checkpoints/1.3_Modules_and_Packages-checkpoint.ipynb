These files should be easily accessible to our main program. Thankfully, Python offers a way to put definitions in a file and then use them in a script or an interactive instance.

Methods, on the other hand, are like actions or behaviors, things the object can do.\n",

    "**Anaconda:** If you have installed Python using Anaconda, you're in luck! Anaconda comes with many popular packages pre-installed, including the ones we've mentioned above. But if you ever find a package you need isn't installed, don't fret! You can add it quite easily. Simply open your system terminal (or cmd if you're on Windows) and type `conda install <package name>`. To update any package, you can use `conda update`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pip:** Sometimes, you may come across a package that's not available in Anaconda. Or maybe you've chosen not to use Anaconda. That's perfectly fine! You can use Python's built-in package installer called `pip`. Assuming pip is installed, just go to your terminal and type `pip install <package name>` . To update a package, you can use `pip install <package name> --upgrade`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, `pip` comes pre-installed with Anaconda and most Python distributions. But if you find that you don't have it, don't worry. You can download or upgrade it from here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/.\n",
