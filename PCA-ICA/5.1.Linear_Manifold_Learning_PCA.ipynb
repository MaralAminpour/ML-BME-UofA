You'll often find yourself dealing with datasets that come with a high number of features, but not so many examples. It's a bit like trying to tell a detailed story with only a few words!\n","\n","Now, this unique situation could increase the chances of overfitting. Why so? Well, when we go into higher dimensions, it's like spreading the same amount of data thinner and thinner, just like butter on an ever-growing slice of bread. This results in a feature space that's filled more and more sparsely.\n","\n","Let's picture it this way: if we divide a region of space into regular cells, similar to a beehive structure, the number of these cells grows exponentially as the dimensionality of the space increases. Just imagine the honeycomb getting bigger and bigger, but with the same amount of honey to fill it! In the world of data, we're faced with a similar challenge: we need to efficiently manage our feature space to prevent overfitting and make the most out of our data.\n","\n","<img src=\"imgs/curseofdimensionality.png\" style=\"max-width:100%; width: 50%; max-width: none\">\n","\n","Now, to fill these cubes, we need a lot of data. Without that, we're more likely to stumble upon a separating hyperplane by chance, making our model more prone to overfitting. So, the challenge here is to trim down our feature space, so it doesn't overshadow the number of data examples. And we have a couple of awesome tools for this - feature selection, which you'll learn about later, and manifold learning, which we'll delve into right now.\n","\n","Manifold Learning is a set of techniques that help us plot the data into a lower-dimensional space, exploiting the data's intrinsic geometry. Most real-world data obeys physical laws and has limited degrees of freedom, which means that they often live on a low-dimensional 'manifold', even when they're in a high-dimensional space. For instance, take a look at this 'Swiss roll model':\n","\n","<img src=\"imgs/swissrollmodel.png\" style=\"max-width:100%; width: 75%; max-width: none\">\n","\n","While it seems to be in three dimensions, its geometry is actually best represented in two dimensions (imagine unrolling it). Manifold learning techniques help to map data to a new space that reveals the underlying geometry more clearly, allowing simpler learning methods to cluster or classify the data.\n","\n","There are various manifold learning methods, divided into linear (transforming data into a subspace) and non-linear methods (leveraging the local neighbourhood structure of the data). In this lecture, we'll discuss the linear approaches, specifically PCA and ICA. And in the upcoming session, we'll explore Laplacian Eigenmaps and Spectral clustering for learning more complex, non-linear structures.\n","\n","Now, let's get into the specifics! Here are the generic modules that we'll be using throughout this notebook:\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","In many biomedical applications we will be faced with datasets that are represented with high dimensional featuresets but relatively few examples. This increases the chances of overfitting as, in ever higher dimensions, the same amount of data fills the featurespace more and more sparsely. Specifically, if we divide a region of space into regular cells we can see that the number of such cells grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the space:\n","\n","<img src=\"imgs/curseofdimensionality.png\" style=\"max-width:100%; width: 50%; max-width: none\">\n","\n","The problem with an exponentially large number of cells is that we would need an exponentially large quantity of training data in order to ensure that the cells are not empty. Without this the chance of finding a separating hyperplane by chance becomes easier, and we become prone to overfitting.  What we need therefore is some way of reducing the featurespace such that the number of features does not significanlty exceed that of the number of data examples. This can be done in a number of ways: feature selection (which you will learn about in future lectures) and manifold learning, which we describe here.\n","\n","Manifold Learning describes a family of methods that seek to map the data into a lower dimensional space by exploiting the underlying geometry of the data.  Typically this is made possible because real world data are subject to physical laws and thus have limited degrees of freedom. This tends to mean that data generated by real world processes live on a low dimensional manifold, embedded within the high dimensional feature space. To explain what this means we can use a fairly artificial example: the 'Swiss roll model:'\n","\n","<img src=\"imgs/swissrollmodel.png\" style=\"max-width:100%; width: 75%; max-width: none\">\n","\n","Here it is clear that whilst the data lives in three dimensions, the geometry of the data is better represented in two (the result of unrolling the embedded representation). This underlying geometry can be determined by exploiting the local neighbourhood structure of the data. In this way it can be shown that the euclidean distance between two different points on the roll in three dimensions can vastly mispresent the true distance along the underlying manifold.\n","\n","Thus, manifold learning techniques are designed to map the data to a new space that better represents the underlying geometry of the data, in this way enabling the use of simpler learning methods that can more sensitivitely cluster or classify the underlying data. Many different methods for manifold learning exist and these can be split into linear methods (that seek to find a sub-space of the data through linearly transforming the data) and non-linear approaches that more successully utlise the local neighbourhood structure of the data. In this lecture we will discuss linear approaches: specifically PCA and ICA. Next week will will introduce Laplacian Eigenmaps and Spectral clustering, which will allow learning of much more complex non-linear structures.\n","\n","Importing generic modules used throughout the notebook:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"hidePrompt":false,"id":"Us1fs9xKVQLy"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from IPython.display import HTML, Image\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","\n","%matplotlib inline"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YzudqoiIVQLz"},"source":["## Linear Transforms"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zlddQz4jVQL0"},"source":["Let's kick things off by chatting about linear transformations.

It's a bit like taking a twisted piece of wire and straightening it out into a simpler, easier-to-handle straight line. The stars of this trick are eigenvectors. These are special vectors in linear transforms that have a unique ability: they stay the same, except for a scale factor, even after the transform is applied. It's like they have an invisibility cloak against transformations! As if they have a special immunity against transformations!\n","\n","To get a bit more technical (with a helping hand from e.g [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors), Eigendecomposition presents linear operators in a simplied, diagonalised form. Specifically, eigenvectors of linear transforms are (non-zero) vectors which remain unchanged (with exception of a scale factor) following application of the transform.\n","\n","\n","<img src=\"imgs/mona_lisa_example.png\" style=\"max-width:100%; width: 50%; max-width: none\">\n","\n","When a shear transformation (imagine it like a big push) is applied to our special eigenvectors (like our blue vector here), they're like the immovable rock in the face of a mighty river.

Its direction gets altered when the same shear transformation is applied.\n","\n","And what about how much our eigenvectors stretch or shrink under the transformation? That's where eigenvalues step into the spotlight. You can think of eigenvalues as the precise measurement that shows by how much the length of an eigenvector changes in the transformation. In other words, they signify the scaling factor that changes the magnitude of the eigenvector during the transformation.\n","\n","Thus eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}$ of a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ obey the following equation:\n","\n","$$A\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda \\mathbf{v}$$\n","\n","and thus may be found by starting from the characteristic equation:\n","\n","$$A\\mathbf{v}-\\lambda \\mathbf{v}=0$$\n","$$ \\rightarrow (A-\\lambda \\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{v}=0$$\n","$$ \\rightarrow |A-\\lambda \\mathbf{I}|=0$$\n","\n","Since we have already defined $\\mathbf{v}$ to be non zero.

It's a function that's linear in nature, but with a bit of a twist.
